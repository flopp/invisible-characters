It serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping at the end of a line."},

Similar to Right-to-left mark (RLM), it is used to change the way adjacent characters are grouped with respect to text direction, with some difference on how it affects the bidirectional level resolutions for nearby characters."},

It determines the specific form of the character preceding it, selects a special variant shape of these vowels, and produces a small gap within the word. It is no longer classified as space character (i.e. in Zs category) in Unicode 6.3.0, even though it was in previous versions of the standard."},

It is represented by the Unicode code point U+2800, and in Braille ASCII with a space. In all Braille systems, the Braille pattern dots-0 is used to represent a space or the lack of content. In particular some fonts display the character as a fixed-width blank. However, the Unicode standard explicitly states that it does not act as a space."},

However, if encountered elsewhere, it should, according to Unicode, be treated as a 'zero width no-break space'. The deliberate use of U+FEFF for this purpose is deprecated as of Unicode 3.2, with the word joiner strongly preferred."},
